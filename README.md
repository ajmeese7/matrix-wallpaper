# matrix-wallpaper

Pretty much just what the description says. Currently, the wallpaper supports
customizable user text (size, content, and color), customizable rain colors
(foreground and background), and features a rainbow mode. The user can also modify
the animation speed and the scheme color for Windows.

**BONUS:** To unlock themes for Wallpaper Engine, go to the settings page by clicking
the upper left icon, navigate to the about page, and type the cheat code of lore:
**UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A ENTER**. Obviously, press the buttons,
don't type out the words. This will also unlock the `k0n4m1` Steam achievement
for Wallpaper Engine.

The project, with all applicable images, is available on Steam
[here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1436702629).
